    The data dive continues!

    As a Data Scientist for a city's school district. the task was helping the school board and mayor make 
    strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

    With full access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, 
    the responsibility was to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance

    This was likely to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. 

 The data set should reflect each of the following:

```diff
@@ District Summary@@
```

    * Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
      * Total Schools
      * Total Students
      * Total Budget
      * Average Math Score
      * Average Reading Score
      * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
      * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
      * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

```diff
@@ School Summary@@
```

    * Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
      * School Name
      * School Type
      * Total Students
      * Total School Budget
      * Per Student Budget
      * Average Math Score
      * Average Reading Score
      * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
      * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
      * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

```diff
@@Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)@@
```

    * Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
      * School Name
      * School Type
      * Total Students
      * Total School Budget
      * Per Student Budget
      * Average Math Score
      * Average Reading Score
      * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
      * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
      * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

```diff
@@ Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)@@
```

    * Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the 
    same metrics as above.
